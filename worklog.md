Task ID: 1
Agent: Z.ai Code (principal architect session)
Task: Produce the single consolidated design + implementation plan document for Project Vaerion (Master Blueprint) — architecture, trade-offs, module boundaries, interfaces, risks, improvements, and implementation plan, per the user's output-style contract. No implementation code; approval gate enforced.

Work Log:
- Analyzed the Vaerion brief: AI-native development engine, local-first, terminal-first, plugin-first, SDK-first; v0.1 pillar list (Runtime, CLI, Project Intelligence, AI Runtime, Model Gateway, Python/TS/Extension SDKs, Public API, Package Builder, Docs); cloud explicitly out of scope.
- Created `docs/` directory in project root.
- Authored the complete Master Blueprint at `/home/z/my-project/docs/vaerion-master-blueprint.md` (~1,100 lines), following the mandated 12-section output order plus supporting sections:
  - §1 Executive Summary with architecture overview diagram and three load-bearing ideas (source-of-truth chain vaerion.yaml→vaerion.lock→spec/, single event spine, unified permission broker).
  - §2 Product thesis (IS/IS-NOT tables), doctrine mapping to Git/Docker/Cargo/K8s.
  - §3 Objectives incl. measurable budgets (≤25 MB binary, ≤60 ms cold start p50, ≥12k files/min indexing).
  - §4 Requirements ID-stamped R-*/NFR-* with verification methods.
  - §5 Architecture: L0–L4 layer model with forbidden-dependency matrix, 14-crate ownership table, explicit technology trade-off tables (Rust/tokio/axum/SQLite-WAL/tree-sitter/WASI-P2/VaerYaml/cassette-evals), cross-cutting concerns, state-store inventory, language tiering.
  - §6 Monorepo folder structure + user project layout + structure-protection rules.
  - §7 Interfaces: exhaustive-ish vaerion.yaml schema skeleton, stable Rust port traits, Public HTTP API route table, canonical event envelope JSON shape, Python/TS SDK excerpts, machine-mode promises.
  - §8 Data flows: annotated agent-run trace, watch-mode indexer pipeline, degraded-mode choreography, package build/verify loop.
  - §9 Security: principals, credential protocol, prompt-injection containment stack, extension threat-model checklist, supply-chain posture, per-OS sandbox matrix, hash-chained audit log.
  - §10 Performance budget waterfalls and bench-as-CI-gate policy.
  - §11 DX: full CLI grammar, onboarding minute-scale promises, E#### error culture.
  - §12 Testing pyramid + hermeticity rules + chaos kill/resume suite + golden governance + AI eval harness (cassettes/MockBrain).
  - §13 Documentation plan incl. llms.txt generation for AI consumption.
  - §14 Release/distribution channels and cadence.
  - §15 Delivery plan: milestones M0–GA (24 weeks), workstreams/staffing, Definition of Done.
  - §16 Scored risk register (R-1..R-10) with mitigation owners/triggers.
  - §17 ADR digest 0001–0017; §18 four recommended sharpenings to the original brief; §19 five blocking decision requests for sign-off; §20 glossary.
- Noted and ignored a garbled/non-actionable fragment ("master blue ![@XSS:0x57A.") at the end of the user message; treated as paste artifact.

Stage Summary:
- Deliverable exists: `/home/z/my-project/docs/vaerion-master-blueprint.md` (DRAFT v1.0 — FOR APPROVAL).
- Key decisions proposed and pending user approval: CLI name `vae`; Rust core + tokio/axum; SQLite+WAL+FTS5+sqlite-vec storage; WASI-P2 extension ABI with broker-mediated capabilities; VaerYaml strict-subset config; cassette/MockBrain hermetic evals; loopback daemon with pairing token; .vxn reproducible bundles.
- NO implementation code written anywhere — per brief, implementation is gated on blueprint approval (§19 Q1–Q5 must be answered before M0 begins).
